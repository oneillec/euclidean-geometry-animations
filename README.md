# Ruler and Compass Construction within VivioJS

## Running the animations

Animations are contained at the following path: ..\animations\construction geometry

To run an animation, open any of the HTM files in the "construction geometry" folder (e.g. ..\animations\construction geometry\pentagon 100.htm) in any desktop web browser. VivioJS animations can run in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE and Edge on Windows, Linux, OS X.

## Controlling animation playback

Animation playback is controlled using the mouse buttons, mouse wheel and keys on the keyboard. Start or pause playback by clicking the left mouse button on the animation background. Increase or decrease the animation speed by pressing the CTRL key and rotating the mouse wheel. Single step the animation forwards and backwards by pausing the animation and then rotating the mouse wheel. If the left mouse button is now clicked, playback will resume in the direction of the last step. 

Snap to the next or previous checkpoint by pausing the animation and then pressing the SHIFT key and rotating the mouse wheel. Checkpoints have not been implemented in all animations but if you wish to see this feature in action, run the pentagon construction animation which has checkpoints for each step of the animation (file location: ..\animations\construction geometry\pentagon 100.htm)

The arrow keys, normally on the right hand side of the keyboard, can be used in lieu of a mouse. The left and right arrows are equivalent to rotating the mouse wheel forwards and backwards and the down arrow is equivalent to pressing the left mouse button. Press the up arrow to reset the animation.

Holding down SHIFT and pressing the up arrow will show/hide playback statistics. Holding down CTRL and pressing the up arrow will show/hide the minimum bounding boxes (mbbs) indicating the areas of the screen that are redrawn on each animation step. Pressing the F11 key puts the browser in full screen mode.
